## Reducing the Browser Attack Surface

- Disable, remove or uninstall anything that you don't use
  - especially those that use the internet: browsers, browsers plugins and extensions
- Disable or limit Java, Flash, Silverlight
- Disable or limit Javascript, browser applications e.g. PDF reader
  - JS is needed but can be a security problem e.g. malvertising using JS
  - Plugin "QuickJava" to enable disable JS / Java /Flash but not Flash
  - If anonymity is a priority, JS has to be disabled
