## Wi-Fi Weaknesses - WEP

also known as IEEE802.11, password can be cracked within seconds

**Deficiencies**

1. Use of static encryption keys - No session keys, weak RC4 used, same password
2. Lack of packet integrity assurance - Bits can be changed
3. The ineffective use of initialization vectors (IVs) - IVs not random enough, only 24-bits, IVs with the same key, chrackable in seconds
