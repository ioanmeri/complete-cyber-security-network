## Passwords

Passwords are one of the weakest links in security
- Need to be using different and strong passwords
- most probable scenario of password leak is from a website hacked
- phishing attacks are another very common method of compromising your passwords
- password could be captured in transit if not encrypted
- stolen by a malware / keyloggers / spyware / shoulder surfing / email account

Tool: haveibeenpwned.com

Search to see if any of your previous or current passwords associated with any of your email addresses or usernames have been compromised

A password is as secure, as the least secure place it is being used
