## Types of Tracking

There are many ways you can be tracked online. Different entities track you in different ways and for different reasons.

- Everything you do in a **website**, in most cases, it will be logged, even if you don't log into.
- **3rd party sites**, those are linked out from a site you visit.
- **Ad Networks** like yahoo and google they track you if you seeing an ad provided by them, or any other type of ad network or ad provider.
- Your **E-mail Provider** will know everyone that you message, have access to all your emails, will be able to track websites you visit.
- **Internet Service Providers** will probably log the websites you visit and DNS queries you make
- **Telco - Cell Provider** will also track you like ISP, but will also log information about the geographic location or movements.
- **Governments - LEAs** cound track you specifically if you are a target
- **Work - University - School** will probably log the websites you visit, DNS queries, and may even log the content. Can even monitor https traffic by placing trusted certificates on your client, or simply run a monitor program on the client or machine.
- While using **Public/Shared Wi-Fi** you should assume that the sites you visit are logged by the Wi-Fi provider
- Any **Man-In-The-Middle** can potentially monitor you, encryption helps, but not a complete panacea
- Anyone with **Access to Machine** can monitor you. For example if it's at work or university or school they can have administration tools for monitoring. If it's hackers or someone malicious it's rats and key loggers can installed remotely and the same for a legitimate owner
- **Local Network** can monitor you
- **Radio - Wi-Fi / 3G / 4G** can be used to geographically locate you and possibly crack that communication to monitor you

**Encrypting** the traffic is usually a strong roadblock to monitoring and cracking, but there are always way around that encryption
