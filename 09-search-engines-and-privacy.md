## Search Engine Tracking, Censorship and Privacy

Google is not only a search engine, but offers many services which makes their ability to track you expodentially more powerfull.

Other sites, help the search engines to track you, because embedded in other sites not owned by Google are Google analytics code, social media buttons and scripts

Google has coorporate agreements with other websites to negotiate and share information to understand better who you are, so they can sell better to you

If you are not logged in to Google, it will recognise the browser because of the persistent cookies, NID and SID

Terms of use tool: `https//tosdr.org/`

Your search engine will be used to enforce censorship. The content you view will be manipulated or customized based on your search history, a form of corporate censorship.

For example, you may be given a more expensive price for a service based on you history, your demographic, your browser, and your spending habits.

More traditional form of censorship, is nation state sponsors censorship like China's blocking of Google results relating to the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen sqaure protests

Memory Hole system: logs queries entered into search engines and associates each search with an IP address

Marbled gecko: Information about the use of Google Earth and Google Maps

## ixquick and Startpage

Alternative search engines that help protect your privacy and anonymity and bypass censorship

> The IP address that is associated with your search will NOT be recorded or shared

Google will be able to identify your browser from the visited website, because of the google scripts it contains

You need to disable cookies and other tracking methods in advance of using `startpage` for Google

Instead, you can use the Proxy method in startpage and the IP of the proxy will be presented to the website and cookies won't be stored in the browser
- On the downside, the proxy is slowwer

Tool to check the SSL cipher: `ssllabs.com`
